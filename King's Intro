Hey! ðŸ‘‹ , how are you feeling?

Thanks for putting in the effort to read this my friend ðŸ˜„

My name is âœ¨ King âœ¨

I work on Nintendo Switch Modifications, and also work on modifications for the video game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. 

ðŸŒ± I occasionally look at the tech community and what skills I can apply in it!

I am open to collaborate on any projects that could use my skill.

I am slightly interested in learning how to code ðŸ¤”, and if granted the time, will accept help. 

Some of the links posted on my profile provide a means of contacting me, feel free to use them ðŸ’¬ , and don't be afraid to ask me anything (appropriate)!

In case you were wondering, I'm a little shy, so I don't feel comfortable sharing my pronouns 

In terms of my general occupation - I am a performing artist who dabbles in entreneurship and owns a conglomerate!
